HTML and Css projects Below are some example sites I made while learning HTML and Css and utilizing bootstrap and javascript.
Projects using javascript, basic and small but showing the exercises we've gone though.

Some of those include:

Projects:

-Calculator (functional basic calculator)

-TicTacToe Game (Interactive game with the computer) -SpaceStation Project

-OnePage Project (Show casing all about puppies and adopting them!)

-BootStrap Cinamas Project (Basic Movie Theater web page with show listings)

-Space Station - This project helped me understand how to use CSS within a navbar, images, containers and a form. This is a page for training and not operational.
